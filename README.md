# Greenclassify 🥬

Greenclassify is a web-based vegetable classification application. It uses a Deep Learning model to identify different types of vegetables from images uploaded by the user.

## 🚀 Features
* **Image Upload:** Users can upload images of vegetables via a clean web interface.
* **Real-time Classification:** The app processes the image using a pre-trained CNN model.
* **Flask Backend:** A lightweight Python server handles the routing and model inference.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Custom Styles)
* **Backend:** Python, Flask
* **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow/Keras
* **Image Processing:** Pillow (PIL), NumPy

## 📦 Project Structure
Based on the current repository:
* `app.py`: The main Flask application script.
* `train.py`: The script used for model training and data processing.
* `templates/`: Contains the `index.html` for the user interface.
* `static/`: Stores CSS, JavaScript, and image assets.
* `Dataset/`: Contains the training and validation data.
